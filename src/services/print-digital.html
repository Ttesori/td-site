          <strong>Reports & Proposals.</strong> Need to tell the full story, explain your impact, or lay out the details
          for a grant or board meeting? I design long-form materials like annual reports, business plans, grant
          proposals, and strategic documents that are meant to be read, saved, and shared. These are polished, formal pieces that help nonprofit organizations and small businesses communicate clearly, whether it’s to a funder, a board, or a new partner.

          <strong>Decks & One-Sheets. </strong> When you want to keep it short and visual, decks and one-pagers are your
          best friend. I design pitch decks, sponsorship packets, pricing sheets, and program overviews that are easy to
          skim, present, or share in a meeting. Think: clear, brand-aligned, and ready to support a conversation or make
          a quick impression.

          <strong>Social Media Graphics. </strong>Instagram posts and stories, Facebook covers and updates, Threads,
          Bluesky — wherever you’re showing up online, I can help you look good doing it. I design custom, on-brand
          graphics sized for each platform so you don’t have to crop, squish, or reformat a thing, saving you time and
          frustration. Just post and go!

          <strong>Brand Support. </strong> If your brand is feeling a little scattered (or you’re still using a logo
          someone made in PowerPoint ten years ago), I can help bring things into focus. I offer mini-refreshes to
          refine your existing brand, brand guidelines to help your team stay consistent, and an asset organization
          service so you always know which file to use and when.

          <strong>Postcards, Brochures & Print Pieces. </strong> Whether you’re promoting an event, sharing resources,
          or mailing something out to your customers, I design clean, eye-catching print pieces that feel like you.
          Postcards, brochures, invitations: all customized to your brand and sized to your printer’s specs, with no
          weird margins or pixelated logos in sight.

          <strong>Business Cards & Stationary. </strong>Branded basics don’t have to be boring. I design business cards,
          letterhead, envelopes, and even editable templates (like Word or Google Docs) that help you look consistent
          across the board. These are the everyday tools that make your work feel more polished and professional,
          without adding extra work for you.

          <strong>Signs & Event Materials. </strong> Whether you’re hosting, tabling, or speaking at an event, I can
          create signs and displays that feel cohesive and easy to read. Think: banners, step-and-repeats, yard signs,
          A-frames, table signs, and other event-day print pieces. I’ll make sure everything fits your brand and prints
          beautifully - no late-night formatting stress required!
