    {
    question: "What’s it like working with you? What’s the Website Refresh process like?",
    answer: "<p>My goal is to make this as easy and low-stress as possible. After you book, I’ll ask a few simple questions about your site and your goals. From there, I’ll review your site, outline the planned updates, and confirm we’re on the same page. Then you can relax — I’ll handle the Refresh and check in with you when everything’s ready. You’ll always know what’s happening, but you won’t need to manage the process or chase down details.</p>"
    },
    {
    question: "Can you refresh my entire website in one session?",
    answer: "<p>Website Refresh is designed to update and improve your existing site, not to rebuild it from scratch or move it to a new platform. If your site needs a full rebuild, I’ll recommend the best next steps.</p>"
    },
    {
    question: "What website platforms do you work with?",
    answer: "<p>I can work with most common platforms, including WordPress, Squarespace, Wix, and Weebly. If you’re not sure whether your site is a good fit, just send me a message and I’ll take a look.</p>"

    },
    {
    question: "What if I’m not sure exactly what I need?",
    answer: "<p>That’s completely normal! Many of my clients know their site feels off but aren’t sure why. I’ll help you identify the most valuable improvements we can make during your Refresh.</p>"
    },
    {
    question: " What if you find a bigger issue while working?",
    answer: "<p>If I discover something that’s outside the scope of a Website Refresh, I’ll pause and check with you before proceeding. No surprise charges, no pressure - just a clear conversation about options.</p>"
    },
    {
    question: "Is the $995 price really a flat fee?",
    answer: "<p>Yes! Website Refresh is a flat $995. The goal is to keep this simple and predictable for you. If we find that your site needs work beyond the scope of a Refresh, I’ll recommend the right next steps.</p>"
    }, {
    question: "Can I get help with future updates after the Refresh?",
    answer: "<p>Absolutely. Many clients choose to book occasional Website SOS sessions or ongoing support after their Refresh. You’ll never have to figure it all out alone.</p>"
