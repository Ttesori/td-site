    {% set faqItems = [
    {
    question: "What’s it like working with you?",
    answer: "<p><strong>I try to make it as low-stress as possible! </strong>We’ll have an initial meeting to talk about
      your work and
      what you’re looking for. From there, I’ll get to work designing the site and writing the content (or polishing
      what you send me). Once the first version is ready, we’ll review it together, test everything, and make any
      final tweaks. Then we launch!</p>
    <p>The whole process usually takes about 4 weeks once we get started, depending on your availability for feedback
      and approvals. I’ll guide you through each step so you’re never left wondering what comes next.</p>"
    },
    {
    question: "Can I add more pages or request additional features?",
    answer: "<p><strong>Absolutely!</strong> The base package includes up to 5 pages, which is plenty for most folks,
      but we can add more
      if you need them. I also offer things like landing pages, donation buttons, or email sign-up forms. If there’s
      something specific you have in mind, just ask and I’ll let you know what’s possible.</p>"

    },
    {
    question: "How does the monthly payment option work?",
    answer: "<p><strong>If the full price isn’t doable upfront,</strong> you can choose the monthly plan to spread the
      cost over 18
      months instead. You’ll still get the exact same service - there’s no difference in what’s included. We’ll launch
      your website after your third monthly payment, and ownership of the site transfers to you once the full balance is
      paid. Until then, I’ll make sure everything’s working smoothly.</p>"
    },
    {
    question: "Why don't you use something like WordPress or Squarespace to build websites?",
    answer: "<p><strong>While I've certainly used systems like Wordpress or Squarespace</strong> to build websites in
      the past, nowadays I gravitate more toward building sites as (nerdy term!) static websites because they’re faster,
      more
      secure, and more affordable to run. That means no plugins to update, no surprise downtime, and no bloated admin
      area
      you have to manage. They're kind of like a lightweight, low-maintenance version of a regular website - and unless
      you need advanced features, they're a great fit for small businesses and nonprofits
      who just want something that works.</p>"
    },
    {
    question: "What if I already love using WordPress or Squarespace?",
    answer: "<p><strong>That works too!</strong> I specialize in building static sites that are fast and
      low-maintenance, but I’ve
      worked with WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, and others. The pricing on this page is based on the workflow I’ve
      developed for static sites, however, so if you’re looking for something different, I’ll work up a custom quote.
      Just send me a message and we can talk it through!</p>"
