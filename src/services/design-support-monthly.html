    question: "If I have unused hours, do they roll over to the next month?",
    answer: "<p><strong>They don’t, but here’s why: </strong> I reserve space in my schedule for you each month based on
      the plan you choose. That way, I can prioritize your requests and make sure I have the capacity to support you
      well — even during busy seasons.</p>
    <p>
      Think of it like booking a standing appointment: even if you don’t use all of your time, I’ve held that space for
      you. It helps me keep things running smoothly for all my clients (and for my own creative energy too).</p>
    <p>
      That said, if you ever have a quieter month, we can talk about how to make the most of the time — whether that’s
      refreshing an older piece or working ahead on something you’ve been meaning to update.</p>"

    question: "How do I know how long design tasks will take?",
    answer: "<p class=\"mb-2\"><strong>You can always ask! </strong> I’ll give you a time estimate before beginning any
      new request. <strong>You’ll also find a cheat sheet below</strong> with rough estimates for common design
      projects, just to

    question: "Is there a commitment?",
    answer: "<p><strong>Not at all. </strong> You can go month-to-month and cancel any time (though I can’t offer
      refunds for the current month).
      If you’d like to save a little, I offer 10% off for a 3-month plan and 20% off for a 6-month plan — just let me
      know you’re interested in a longer commitment.</p>"
    },
    {
    question: "What kinds of design work can I use my hours for?",
    answer: "<p><strong>Just about anything I offer! </strong> Social media graphics, brochures, one-pagers, slide
      decks, website updates, branded templates, signage, sponsorship materials, and more. If you’re not sure, just ask
      — if I can design it, it counts.</p>"
    },
    {
    question: "How fast will I get things back?",
    answer: "<p><strong>Most requests are completed in 2–3 business days, </strong>depending on complexity. I’ll always
      confirm the timeline with you before starting, and if something will take longer, I’ll let you know upfront.</p>"
    },
    {
    question: "Do I batch my requests or can I send them one at a time?",
    answer: "<p><strong>You’re welcome to send requests however they come up. </strong> Batching isn’t required, but I
      will note that working on multiple items at once is usually more efficient. If you’re hoping to get the most out
      of your hours, batching can help stretch them further.</p>
    <p>
      Each request does have a minimum time charge of 30 minutes, even for quick updates. If you send something that
      would
      take less than that, I’ll let you know before I begin so you can either add more to the request or hold off until
      you have a few things to send at once.</p>"
