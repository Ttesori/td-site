        <span class="accent accent--underline-accent"></span>
      </h2>
      <p><span class="first-line">I’ve been a designer in some form or another</span> since way back in the 1900s (as my
        teenager lovingly calls it). I taught myself to code in middle school, fell in love with graphic design working
        on my high school yearbook, and I haven’t stopped since.</p>
      <p> <span class="first-line">After graduating from Florida State University (go Noles!),</span> I worked with
        state agencies, large corporations, small businesses, and nonprofits - but it’s the last two that feel like
        home. I have so much respect for folks doing the brave thing: building businesses, supporting their communities,
        and showing up even when it’s hard.</p>
      <p>
        <span class="first-line">These days, I can be found running Tesori Design</span> from my cozy home office in
        Colorado...usually rocking Eras Tour merch, with my planner (a necessity!) and a penguin mascot named Ty*
        keeping me company. <br><span class="text-sm font-italic">*Long story, but he’s part personal history, part
          branding
