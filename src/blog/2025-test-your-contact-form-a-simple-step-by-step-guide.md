**Perhaps itâ€™s because the little gremlins that live in the internet tubes get bored,** but Iâ€™ve noticed bits and pieces of our websites love to stop working when weâ€™re not paying attention. And the humble contact form (*arguably your websiteâ€™s most important communication tool!*) is no exception. 

A broken form can mean **missed opportunities and frustrated visitors,** but the good news is that your contact form is super easy to test - and it only takes 5 minutes!

### Step 1: Fill Out Your Contact Form

**Navigate to the page** with the form you want to test, and letâ€™s get started:

* **Fill out the form** using your own name and email.
* Be sure to **fill in all fields** so you can check theyâ€™re all coming through properly.
* **Click submit and watch for a success message** to let you know the form has been submitted successfully.

### Step 2: Check Your Inbox

**Wait about 5 minutes,** then open the inbox that your form submissions are sent to:

* Did you **receive the message**?
* Did it **land in spam** or directly in your inbox?
* Are all the **form fields present** in the email and clearly labeled?

âœ… **If the email looks good,** congratulations - youâ€™re done! You can be confident your form is working correctly and youâ€™ll receive any forms your visitors fill out.

ðŸ›‘ **If you still havenâ€™t received the email after 15 minutes** (and youâ€™ve checked Spam and Trash, just in case), thereâ€™s likely a problem with your form. 

* **If you have access to the form settings**, double-check that the form is going to the correct email address (triple-check for typos!). 
* **If the email address is correct,** itâ€™s likely a bigger issue. But donâ€™t panic - [give me a shout](https://tesoridesign.com/contact/) and Iâ€™ll help you work through it!

### Step 3: Bonus Form Checks & Next Steps

**Once your form passes your initial test,** here are a couple of additional checks to perform:

* **Test the form on mobile.** Everything *should* work the same between desktop and mobile versions of your website, but sometimes errors sneak in. Fill out the form on mobile to make sure itâ€™s all good.
* **Test other forms on your website.** Do you have contact forms for specific services? Or multiple forms on different pages? Test each one to double-check there arenâ€™t any issues.
* **Review your success message.** Make sure the message that appears after a visitor submits a form is friendly, clear and lays out expectations or next steps (such as how long it typically takes you to respond or actions they can take in the meantime).

#### Tip: How Often Should I Test My Contact Form?

**I recommend performing this check monthly** for your most important form and quarterly for the rest - this gives you peace of mind and helps to ensure your form is ready to go when someone wants to reach out.

### One quick check = less website stress

**Testing your contact form** is an easy way to get a boost of confidence that your website is making it easy for your visitors to get in touch with you.
