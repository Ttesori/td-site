Intro
Websites can feel overwhelming—so many “must-have” lists out there.

But honestly? You don’t need everything.

A few solid, thoughtful pages can do more for you than a 20-page site no one reads.

(1–2 sentences...keep it friendly, reassuring, and gently "cut through the noise.")

Section 1: The Essentials Every Small Org Website Needs
(Quick list with short explanations.)

Homepage

Clear intro about who you are and what you do.

A simple welcome—not a wall of text.

About Page

Tell your story. Why you exist. Why it matters.

(Doesn’t have to be long. Just real.)

Services or Programs Page

What you offer, who it’s for, and how people can get involved / work with you.

Focus on clarity, not convincing.

Contact Page

Make it easy. Email, form, maybe a phone number if you use one.

Bonus: clear hours if you meet with people or answer inquiries live.

Simple Navigation

4–5 main links max.

If you need a menu map to explain your menu...it’s too complicated.

Section 2: The Nice-to-Haves (You Can Add Later If You Want)
(Keep it light and validating that they don't need this day one.)

Blog or News Section

Helpful if you regularly have updates or want to share resources...but not mandatory.

Photo Gallery or Portfolio

Great for certain nonprofits or creatives—but if you’re still gathering work, it’s okay to wait.

Testimonials

If you have them, awesome. If you don’t yet, no stress—you can add them as they come in.

Donations / E-commerce

Only needed if it fits your mission (and you’re ready to manage it).

Section 3: What You Can (and Should) Skip at First
(Where your cozy tough love comes in.)

Pop-ups everywhere

Especially those ones asking for emails before people even know who you are.

Overcomplicated sliders and animations

They slow down your site and confuse visitors.

“Coming Soon” Pages That Stay Forever

If a page isn’t ready yet, just leave it off the menu until it is.

(No judgment—we’ve all forgotten about a “coming soon” page before.)

Wrap-Up / Gentle Reassurance
You don’t need a million pages to have a legit, trustworthy website.

Start small, focus on being clear and welcoming.

Add on later if (and only if) it makes sense for you.

If you want help keeping it simple and intentional, you know where to find me.
