**Are you ready for a wild statistic?** [According to a study from Microsoft,](https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/) the average person's attention wanders after only 8 seconds - y'all, that's less than the notoriously-forgetful goldfish! This just goes to show the importance of capturing your audience's attention quickly in social media posts...but what's the secret? How do you build compelling graphics, especially when you don't have a designer on staff AND it's the week before an event AND you are scrambling biiiig-time?

The truth is this: \*\*making effective social media graphics is *hard*.\*\* You've got to stand out amongst the other posts on someone's feed, get them to stop scrolling, and then convey information quickly before they resume scrolling. That's a lot of work for one little graphic!

If you've been graced with the task of putting those graphics together for your org, I want to start off by saying that you're doing \*\*great\*\*...and that the [average engagement on an Instagram post](https://www.socialinsider.io/social-media-benchmarks/instagram) is only 0.5%, so please don't beat yourself up for not going viral. 

Secondly, I want to reduce your event-crunch-time stress and make your job easier by sharing a few quick social media graphic dos and don'ts to make your DIY designing go more smoothly. There's absolutely no judgement here, just help!

### The Dos and Don’ts List

#### ✅ DO use your brand colors consistently. <br> ❌ DON’T use a fun new color in every post.

Consistency builds trust and recognition, so dive in and customize your template to make those colors to match what's in your brand guidelines (you did make those with me, right?).  

Even if you’re partnering with another organization that has different branding, try to sneak in at least one of your own colors — it helps people know it’s you.

#### ✅ DO make sure there's enough contrast for text to be readable. <br>❌ DON’T put light text on a light background or dark text on a dark background.

(Short paragraph explanation: Especially important for accessibility and mobile users.)

3. DO keep text short and simple.
   DON’T cram a whole paragraph onto one graphic.

(Short paragraph explanation: Short text is way more scannable, especially on phones.)

4. DO check your aspect ratios (and sizes).
   DON’T post random crops that get cut off weirdly.

(Short paragraph explanation: Different platforms prefer different dimensions — it's worth making sure your graphic displays properly.)

5. DO create a few go-to templates or layouts.
   DON’T start from scratch every time.

(Short paragraph explanation: Having 2–3 reusable layouts makes your posts feel cohesive and saves you time/decision fatigue.)
