**Are you ready for a wild statistic?** [According to a study from Microsoft,](https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/) the average person's attention wanders after only 8 seconds - y'all, that's less than the notoriously-forgetful goldfish! This just goes to show the importance of capturing your audience's attention quickly in social media posts...but what's the secret? How do you build compelling graphics, especially when you don't have a designer on staff AND it's the week before an event AND you are scrambling biiiig-time?

The truth is: **making effective social media graphics is *hard*.** You've got to stand out amongst the other posts on someone's feed, get them to stop scrolling, and then convey information quickly before they resume scrolling. That's a lot of work for one little graphic!

If you've been graced with the task of putting those graphics together for your org, I want to start off by saying that you're doing **great**...and that the [average engagement on an Instagram post](https://www.socialinsider.io/social-media-benchmarks/instagram) is only 0.5%, so please don't beat yourself up for not going viral. 

To help reduce that event-crunch-time stress and make your job a bit easier, I'm sharing **5 quick social media graphic dos and don'ts** to make your DIY designing go more smoothly. There's absolutely no judgement here, just support!

### The Dos and Don‚Äôts List

#### ‚úÖ DO use your brand colors consistently. <br> ‚ùå DON‚ÄôT use a fun new color in every post.

**Consistency builds trust and recognition,** so dive in and customize your template to make those colors to match what's in your brand guidelines ([you did make those with me, right?](https://tesoridesign.com/blog/2025-05-03-branding/)).  

Even if you‚Äôre partnering with another organization that has different branding, try to sneak in at least one of your own colors - it helps people know it‚Äôs you.

#### ‚úÖ DO make sure your text has enough contrast. <br>‚ùå DON‚ÄôT put light text on a light background or dark text on a dark background.

**With audiences scrolling so quickly,** they'll fly past anything that's too difficult for them to read. One major culprit here is contrast - the difference between your text color and the background behind it. As an example, maximum contrast would be black text on a white background, or vice-versa. 

If you're curious about the contrast between two colors, you can quickly check using [WebAIM's Contrast Checker.](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) This is especially important for accessibility reasons as well as for mobile users who are viewing your graphic on small screens - they need that strong contrast to easily read your copy.

*Bonus tip: If you‚Äôre feeling stuck, you can also make text easier to read by either making it a little bolder or a little bigger.*

#### ‚úÖ DO keep text short and simple. <br> ‚ùå DON‚ÄôT cram a whole paragraph onto one graphic.

**Keeping with the theme of "don't scroll, please!"** limit the text on your graphics to only what is necessary for context. Short text is way more scannable, especially on mobile devices. 

I get it: it might feel weird at first to leave these details out of the graphic itself, but it's actually a strategy! Our goal is to make people curious enough to read the caption or click a link for more.

To test your text, **shrink your graphic down to roughly phone screen size** (or even smaller) and make sure all of your copy is still easily readable.

#### ‚úÖ DO check your image sizes and aspect ratios. <br>  ‚ùå  DON‚ÄôT use the same graphic size for every platform.

**Different platforms expect different dimensions,** and if you don't use the right ones your graphics can have parts get cut off or have the image end up distorted, so it's worth taking the time to make multiple versions. Here's the [preferred dimensions](https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-image-sizes-guide/) for the social media heavy hitters:

* **Facebook:** Landscape: 1080 x 566 | Stories: 1080 x 1920
* **Instagram:** Square: 1080 x 1080 | Stories/Reels: 1080 x 1920
* **Linkedin:** Square: 1200 x 1200 | Landscape: 1200 x 627
* **TikTok:** Vertical/Stories: 1080 x 1920

#### ‚úÖ DO create a few go-to templates or layouts.<br>  ‚ùå DON‚ÄôT start from scratch every time.

**Not having to start from scratch** or scroll through 1000 options in Canva every time you create a graphic is a *lifesaver*. If you know you rotate through the same types of posts - stories, announcements, events, sales/fundraisers, or photos/quotes - you can work up a reusable layout for each type.

Having these templates ready to go saves time, saves your brain from decision fatigue, and makes your posts feel cohesive: which is actually a smart strategy!

**Cohesion helps your audience recognize your posts faster** as they scroll...and that's what you want. And, real talk: unless you're Taylor Swift, I promise your audience is *not* going back and studying your full grid - most folks will only ever see a post or two at a time.

And if you‚Äôre worried about your feed feeling "too repetitive," here‚Äôs a cozy truth: **if you posted a graphic similar to this six months ago (or even last week), no one will notice.** And with small tweaks, like new images, updated text, or a fresh swap of a brand color, you can make a template feel brand new every time anyway. üéâ

### Wrapping it up: you've got this!

**Even with all of these tips in hand,** let's be real: every post isn't going to be perfection and that's totally okay. Social media moves fast, so good enough really is good enough. Showing up on a consistent basis matters far more than creating some perfect graphic.

And that's the good news: *we are alllll about progress over perfection here.* With every graphic you improve just a little bit, that progress adds up. Each stronger post snowballs into a stronger brand over time.

**Even if you only remember one thing from this post** *(I vote for making sure your text is easy to read!)*, that's still a huge win. You are a wonderful human for working to improve your designs, and just reach out if you run into any issues - I'm here for support!
