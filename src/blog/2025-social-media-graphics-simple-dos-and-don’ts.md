**Are you ready for a wild statistic?** [According to a study from Microsoft,](https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/) the average person's attention wanders after only 8 seconds - y'all, that's less than the notoriously-forgetful goldfish! This just goes to show the importance of capturing your audience's attention quickly in social media posts...but what's the secret? How do you build compelling graphics, especially when you don't have a designer on staff AND it's the week before an event AND you are scrambling biiiig-time?

The truth is: **making effective social media graphics is *hard*.** You've got to stand out amongst the other posts on someone's feed, get them to stop scrolling, and then convey information quickly before they resume scrolling. That's a lot of work for one little graphic!

If you've been graced with the task of putting those graphics together for your org, I want to start off by saying that you're doing **great**...and that the [average engagement on an Instagram post](https://www.socialinsider.io/social-media-benchmarks/instagram) is only 0.5%, so please don't beat yourself up for not going viral. 

Secondly, I want to reduce your event-crunch-time stress and make your job easier by sharing a few quick social media graphic dos and don'ts to make your DIY designing go more smoothly. There's absolutely no judgement here, just help!

### The Dos and Don’ts List

#### ✅ DO use your brand colors consistently. <br> ❌ DON’T use a fun new color in every post.

**Consistency builds trust and recognition,** so dive in and customize your template to make those colors to match what's in your brand guidelines ([you did make those with me, right?](https://tesoridesign.com/blog/2025-05-03-branding/)).  

Even if you’re partnering with another organization that has different branding, try to sneak in at least one of your own colors - it helps people know it’s you.

#### ✅ DO make sure there's enough contrast for text to be readable. <br>❌ DON’T put light text on a light background or dark text on a dark background.

With audiences scrolling so quickly, they'll fly past anything that's too difficult for them to read. One major culprit here is contrast - the difference between your text color and the background behind it. As an example, maximum contrast would be black text on a white background, or vice-versa. 

If you're curious about the contrast between two colors, you can quickly check using [WebAIM's Contrast Checker.](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) This is especially important for accessibility reasons as well as for mobile users who are viewing your graphic on small screens - they need that strong contrast to easily read your copy.

Bonus: If you’re feeling stuck, you can also make text easier to read by either making it a little bolder or a little bigger.

#### ✅ DO keep text short and simple. <br> ❌ DON’T cram a whole paragraph onto one graphic.

\*\*Keeping with the theme of "don't scroll, please!"\*\* limit the text on your graphics to only what is necessary for context. Short text is way more scannable, especially on mobile devices. 

I get it: it might feel weird at first to leave these details out of the graphic itself, but it's actually a strategy! Our goal is to make people curious enough to read the caption or click a link for more.

#### ✅ DO check your image sizes and aspect ratios. <br>  ❌  DON’T use the same graphic size for every platform.

\*\*Different platforms expect different dimensions,\*\* and if you don't use the right ones your graphics can have parts get cut off or have the image end up distorted, so it's worth taking the time to make multiple versions. Here's the [preferred dimensions](https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-image-sizes-guide/) for the social media heavy hitters:

* Facebook: Landscape: 1080 x 566 | Stories: 1080 x 1920
* Instagram: Square: 1080 x 1080 | Stories/Reels: 1080 x 1920
* Linkedin: Square: 1200 x 1200 | Landscape: 1200 x 627
* TikTok: Vertical/Stories: 1080 x 1920

#### ✅ DO create a few go-to templates or layouts.<br>  ❌ DON’T start from scratch every time.

(Short paragraph explanation: Having 2–3 reusable layouts makes your posts feel cohesive and saves you time/decision fatigue.)
