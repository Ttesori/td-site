Not everyone’s ready to hire a designer full-time. That doesn’t mean you don’t deserve support. Whether you’re juggling a newsletter, scrambling to resize an image for print, or just tired of guessing if your logo is the right file type, design credits can be a soft landing — support when you need it, no commitment required.

## Design Help That Fits Your Workflow

Sometimes you just need a few things handled — not a full branding overhaul or a six-month retainer. Design credits let you request the help you need, when you need it, without locking yourself into a schedule or subscription.  
It is support on your terms.

## Flexible, Friendly, and Stress-Free

With design credits, you can send requests as you have them.  
Need a flyer cleaned up? A website banner resized? A few tweaks to your sponsorship deck?  
You can use your hours however it makes the most sense for you and your organization.

## Support Without the Overwhelm

Design credits are perfect if you want professional design without the heavy lift of managing a big project. They give you breathing room to focus on the parts of your work that matter most.  
Because good design should feel like a relief — not another item on your to-do list.
