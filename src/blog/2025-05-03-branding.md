If I asked you to think of an iconic brand, which one comes to mind? For me, it would be Apple, Nike or possibly Starbucks (it's nighttime when I'm writing this, and clearly my brain is already plotting tomorrow morning’s coffee). Those brands feel so huge and iconic, because, well they are, and they've spent decades building and cultivating that brand. 

Even the term "branding" itself feels...big. Nebulous. Unwieldy. And maybe like something that's only for those big giant brands with big giant budgets. But at it's core, branding is pretty straightforward - it's simply about making it easy for people to recognize and connect with you. 

### What is branding?

Oftentimes, when I ask folks about their branding I hear, "well, we have a logo" or "ooh we like this shade of blue," but branding is more than logos and colors - if Nike only had that awesome logo, but not the history, product design, and overall brand vibe, they wouldn't be nearly the giant they are. 

What you're looking to cultivate with your brand is an overall feeling people get when they interact with you. Do you want them to feel confident? Energized? Understood? Worried? This may start with your logo and colors, but extends to every interaction folks have with your brand. Your brand is that combinations of visuals and voice that make you recognizable and relatable. 

### Why Branding Matters for Small Orgs

Whether you're running a one-woman show or have a small team in place, it's unlikely you can put up a billboard about your organization in Times Square or spend millions on a Super Bowl ad campaign, so you might be wondering what's the point? Does branding really even help me?

The biggest thing a cohesive, consistent brand offers you, even at the smallest organization level is trust. Building your audience's trust in you is everything - and it builds up faster when you show up consistently. It helps you look steady, professional, and like you actually planned out everything you're doing (even if you're flailing a little bit behind the scenes -- been there!). 

When your branding is good, people remember you without any extra effort on your part. And to me, that makes it 100% worth the time it takes to set it up - who wouldn't love for their marketing work to feel easier?

### How To Start Building Consistent Branding

#### Colors

Pick 1-2 colors you love and use them everywhere. If you really want to dive in deep, you can check out the meanings of colors or how to choose an effective color scheme, but consistency really is the name of the game here.

Once you've chosen your colors \[https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/] (let's call them a primary color and an accent), save those exact colors somewhere where you can find it easily in the future (a note on your phone works fine!). I find it's easiest to have the HEX code available (that's the one that looks like this: #343434) because it's consistently accepted in most apps.

#### Fonts

Again, pick 1-2 fonts and stick with them. I recommend choosing a headline font and a body font and again, write the names down somewhere you'll remember them. If the font used in your logo is easily accessible (and legible!) that's a great place to start. If not, I highly recommend choosing a font pairing that's available on Google Fonts as that will make it as easy as possible for you to use it across all of your projects.

#### Your Audience

Take a few moments to write down who your brand is for. I know it can be tempting to say "everyone!" but narrowing this down will help those folks feel like you're speaking directly to them (which makes it harder to scroll past your message). So, if you're a plumber, your audience shouldn't be "everyone who owns property" -- narrow it down to something more specific like "first-time homeowners who need help navigating repairs."

From there, you can absolutely create specific messages that speak to different parts of your audience. Maybe one post is for renters, one campaign is for landlords. But everything still feels connected because it's all anchored to the same bigger mission and audience. And when you focus on a more specific group, even just for one campaign or message, you can speak more clearly and make people feel like you *get* them, which is more likely to inspire action.

#### Tone

Write down a few words that describe your brand's overall vibe. \[https://brandkit.com/asset-page/1611-brand-personality-adjectives] Are you friendly? Professional? Energized? All three? Having these words somewhere you can reference easily makes the job of nailing the vibe of your brand much easier - whether it's in visuals or in writing.

#### Logo

If you can do one thing that will save you so much time in the future, take an hour or two and save every version of your logo that you have in an easily findable folder. And then name every version with what it is so you can easily pick the right one when you need to. Here's a little cheatsheet with what to look for:

* JPG: Can be low resolution (for the web) or higher resolution (for print). If the file size is <100kb, it's probably pretty small. 
* PNG: A web format that typically has a transparent background.
* SVG: A web format that is a vector, meaning it can be resized to any size without losing quality.
* AI/EPS: A professional vector format that can be opened in Adobe Illustrator. Typically used to send to printers for print work.
* PDF: A total grab bag - this could be vector or it could be an JPG someone just saved as a PDF

Once you have all of those versions easily organized, make sure you're consistently using the same ones throughout various platforms. 

### Final Thoughts

Your brand absolutely doesn't have to be perfect - remember, we're not Nike or Apple here! Your goal should simply be to cultivate a brand that is consistent enough to feel familiar to your audience. It's just about helping people recognize you, trust you, and feel good about working with you. 

Remember: Your brand isn’t something you have to invent from scratch. A little organization is all it takes to help your brand feel more connected, more recognizable, and more *you.*
