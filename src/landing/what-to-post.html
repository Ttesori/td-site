      <ul class="featured__list">
        <li><strong>Social media isn't your favorite thing,</strong> but you know you should probably post...<em>something</em></li>
        <li><strong>You know what to post</strong> when there's an event or sale, but struggle with the in-between times</li>
        <li><strong>You stare at the "create post" button</strong> wondering what other businesses even talk about</li>
        <li><strong>You're tired of scrambling </strong>for something "important" to say every time you want to stay visible</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="main_content__subtitle main_content__subtitle--title"><span class="accent accent--icon-checkbox accent--icon-checkbox--sm"></span> Why Does It Matter?</h3>
      <p><strong>Staying visible doesn't mean you need breakthrough announcements every week.</strong> Sometimes the best posts come from being human and helpful...and that's perfectly enough.</p>
      <p><strong>Use the templates to:</strong> share behind-the-scenes moments that build connection, answer questions your community has, celebrate the people who matter to your work, and keep showing up even when "nothing" is happening.</p>
